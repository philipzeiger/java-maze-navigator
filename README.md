# java-maze-navigator
A Java program that finds the shortest exit for a maze given as a text file (made up of 1s and 0s, 1s being walls and 0s being pathways) with the number of rows, columns, and the starting vertice listed in the text file. A sample maze textfile is included.

**WIP**
Dependency on TextFileClass needs to be replaced. I could not include TextFileClass because I did not write it and it is not open source (a University Professor wrote it and provided it for my Artificial Intelligence class).
